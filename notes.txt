treat as throwaway file for random notes and ideas

OOP? never used in Python before but could be a good idea as the task is relatively simple

basic ideas and process structure: 
1 frame = 2 rolls
maximum of 10 pins after both rolls / per frame (mostly; see final round)
spare: hit 10 after 2 rolls (e.g. [6,4])
strike: hit 10 on 1st roll and skip second roll ([10])
final round/frame: players can roll up to 3 times if they get a spare/strike, the sum can exceed 10 here

feature                         example                         test case
rolling a ball                  roll(pins)                      valid rolls, invalid rolls
calculating score               10 frames, no strikes/spares    [1,4],[5,3], etc
spare logic                     [5,5] -> bonus next roll        [6,4,2] = 12 for frame 1
strike logic                    [10] -> bonus next 2 rolls      [10,3,4] =  17 for frame 1
perfect game                    12x [10]                        score = 300
gutter game                     20x [0]                         score = 0
edge cases                      final frame spare/strikes
